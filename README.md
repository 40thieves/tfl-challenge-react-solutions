# tfl-challenge-react-solutions

This is @40thieves' solution to the [TfL Challenge]().

Each level is on it's own branch:

- [Level 100 source]() and [level 100 deployed]()
- [Level 200 source]() and [level 200 deployed]()
- [Level 300 source]() and [level 300 deployed]()
- [Level 999 source]() and [level 999 deployed]()

## Notes

### Minimal viable solution

For each level, the bare minimum has been done to meet the requirement.

This reduces the amount of code for students to read.

### Tailwind CSS

A CDN copy of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) has been installed to provide styling. Only a small amount of effort was put into adding Tailwind classes.

No attempt at responsive design has been made.

## Installation

Each level has been deployed to Netlify (see above), so you shouldn't need to.

But if you really need to, this project was made with [Create-React-App](http://create-react-app.dev/), so you can follow the normal instructions:

- Clone this project
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
- Run `npm install`
- Check out the branch you're interested in
- Run `npm start`
